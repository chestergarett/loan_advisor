## General Framework
1. What are MSMEs? 
2. Why are they important to us?
3. What's their issue?
4. What's the current solution?
5. Is the current solution working? What are the issues with it?
	- The Missing Link is Consolidated Knowledge about these offerings
6. How does our app solve these issues?
	- Our app is a consolidator. It makes it easy for an MSME to find the loan that fits it the best

For MSMEs:
- DTI MSME Statistics: https://www.dti.gov.ph/resources/msme-statistics/
- Why lend to MSMEs?
	- They make up 99% of total businesses in the PH
	- They make up X percentage of GDP
	- Yet they are an underserved market
	- Up to 70% of MSMEs struggles to access credit
	- What happens to these MSMEs and what is the impact to the economy of they continue to die out?
	- To provide a solution for this, the government has issued the Magna Carta for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which mandates the lending to these businesses.
	- This mandate was issued in 2008, but did we see a rise in lending to MSMEs?
	- What is the general goal of the Magna Carta?


For Banks and Lending Institutions:
- How has the government helped ease this issue for MSMEs?
- This is the timeline for laws related to MSME lending:
	- 1991, RA 6977: MA for Small
	- 1997, RA 8289: Amendment to include Medium
	- 2008, [[RA 9501]]: 
		- Operationalization of prior with compliance metrics
		- Mandatory lending for banks and lending institutions
		- Government support for MSMEs
- According to the Magna Carta for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), officially known as Republic Act No. 9501, all lending institutions in the Philippines, whether government or private, are required to allocate certain parts of their portfolio to MSMEs.
- Total of 10% should go to MSMEs 
	- 8% to small 
	- 2% to medium
- This was issued in 2008 but so far the progress is dismal? Have to check this

Issue:
- So what's missing? MSMEs are in need of lending and banks, government and lending institutions are there to give a hand.
